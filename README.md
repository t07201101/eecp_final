To reproduce the result of demo:
1. Run graph_1.ipynb to get the graph of radius over time of an asteroid with any given orbital resonance.
2. Run graph_2.ipynb to get the graph of radius over orbital resonance of 200 asteroids after a given time.
3. Run simulation_1.ipynb to get the orbiting simulation of an asteroid with any given orbital resonance.
4. Run simulation_2.ipynb to get the orbiting simulation of 200 asteroids with orbital resonances of 1.5 to 5.0.
